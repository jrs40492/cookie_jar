# My Cookie Jar & More

This was built for a lady attempting to open a new bakery in Western NY. Unfortunately, due to issues with NY laws, the bakery was never able to be opened.

I recently refactored the code to use it as an example project. However, I'd like to refactor it even more and remove the need for MDL and jQuery.

### Setup & Installation

```
1. Currently this uses the program Codekit (Mac only) to process files. Plan on integrating Gulp/Grunt/Webpack in the future.
```
